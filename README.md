# stubsy-void-packages

My own package templates that doesn't meet the void-packages requirements or haven't been contributed yet.

I use symlinks to void-packages/srcpkgs so they are all available in the same place:

    ln -s ~/.local/pkgs/stubsy-void-packages/srcpkgs/* ~/.local/pkgs/void-packages/srcpkgs/
